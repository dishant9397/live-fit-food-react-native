# Live Fit Food (React Native)
* The mobile application, which can run on both iOS and Android devices, was developed using React Native Framework, which is exact duplicate of Live Fit Food Website. 
* This application was facilitated to me as a part of my Advanced Web Development Project. 
* The application can do basic user functions such as registration, login and also login with phone number, which was an exceptional functionality. 
* User is provided with copious meal options and can order by selecting a meal. 
* After meal is selected, user is given an option to add tip; further, moving ahead, current location of user would be monitored on accepting the location's permission. 
* However, user can pickup the meal only after he/she is located within 100 metres from store. User can navigate to screen where information of all previous orders can be seen.  
  
*Note: Firebase was used for authentication, database and storage purposes.*
